#Training: Express Routing Practice

### Sherie Carter

#Reflection

I only was able to complete the art gallery portion of this. I had assistance from the TA, which is helpful. The assignment included things we already did in class so I was able to take from my other in class assignments in order to complete this. I am going to spend some extra time on this topic today.
